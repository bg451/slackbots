This one is meant to be scheduled, not to be used as a slash command. After uploading, go into HUD
and schedule it to run every hour. 

## Additional steps required to run this Bot

This bot uses [IronCache](http://www.iron.io/cache) to store results temporarily. 
Create an iron.json file in this directory with your Iron.io project_id and token.
